### Contact Details
The team has decided to utilise Discord and Zoom to keep in contact with each other and will be where all meetings are conducted. Email will be used to contact the Project Managers and the team's work will be stored on Google Drive and managed on Trello.

### Team's Process Model
The team’s process model is a variant of Scrum. Instead of daily meetings, a meeting will be conducted every 2-3 days. The sprints will also be within a 2 week timespan. 

## Time and task tracking
### Allocation of tasks and Progress Tracking
After the sprint backlog has been finalised, team members will choose their own tasks to complete based on their expertise. If a task is not chosen by any team member, the Scrum master will allocate the task to one or more team members to work on. Trello and Google drive will be used for formal documentation of progress. Day-to-day progress will be discussed on Discord among team members.

# Analysis of Alternatives

# Risk Register
| ID | Risk Description | Likelihood of the risk occuring | Impact if the risk occurs | Severity | Owner | Mitigating Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Team members have different schedules so it could impact meeting times | medium | medium | medium | All team members | Postponed meetings(make-up meetings), quick updates on our progress and what to work on through logs. |
